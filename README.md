**GoLogParser**

This repository hosts a binary tool tailored to parse log files generated by the standard Go log library. The tool enables users to extract and manipulate log messages, including removing timestamps by default and providing an option to display timestamps in the "hh:mm:ss" format.

**How to Use:**

1. **Download:** Obtain the binary tool from the latest release in the repository.
2. **Execution:** Run the binary alongside log files created using the standard Go log library.
3. **Options:** Utilize the "--show-timestamp" flag to display timestamps in "hh:mm:ss" format.

**Example:**

```bash
$ tail -n4 log.txt | ./gologparser
Attempting to release lock
Successfully released lock
Failed to process job payload no stored jobs for the user
POST     "/job"

$ tail -n4 log.txt | ./gologparser --show-timestamp
04:44:45 Attempting to release lock
04:44:45 Successfully released lock
04:44:45 Failed to process job payload no stored jobs for the user
POST     "/job"
```
